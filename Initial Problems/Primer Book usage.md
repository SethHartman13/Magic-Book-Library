I am not sure how I am going to cast the spell without a spell slot with the best spellcasting ability.

What I might have to do... is make it create an action where the person then uses it to cast... which I want to avoid as that would require us to map out the IDs for each spell. I don't want to do that.

Alternative (but likely)... I think I can cast the spell and modify the dc and spell attack... research will be required. But we shall see.
