While we can group spells by sourcebook, we need to keep in mind that there are people that can buy the spells rather than the entire sourcebook. I think we need to create a catalog of sorts of all spells and tie them to a shorthand code. For example, If I owned Arcane Gate from the Player's Handbook, I would give the authenticator the code "PHB001" and then it would let me have access to that spell. Problem though, is I can see it having conflicts with licensing. However... if a player tries to cast a spell that is not available to them (as I plan on using the cast alias to do stuff) it won't let them do it regardless and therefore licensing is enforced. We will have to discuss this further.

Just had idea. Let players have the ability to import their own sources, allowing for those who have the individual spells to add them, but by using the cast alias, we should be able to inhibit those who try to circumnavigate licensing.
