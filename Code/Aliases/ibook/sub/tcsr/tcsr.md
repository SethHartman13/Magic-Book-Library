Subalias to subscribe to the spells within the Tal'Dorei Campaign Setting Reborn

## Help:
`!ibook sub tcsr`: Subscribes to the Tal'Dorei Campaign Setting Reborn

## Licensing:
This subalias requires owning the spells from the [Tal'Dorei Campaign Setting Reborn](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/tcsr):
- Freedom of the Waves
- Freedom of the Winds

## JSONs:
Don't bother trying to manually put these spells in if you do not have access to them as Avrae will not let you cast the spell without having access to them.
